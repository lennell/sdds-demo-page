- Demo page built on angular and using SDDS components, with very little or no modifications.

- Uses angular routing for routing
- Uses ngrx for app state management.
- Not entirely built for mobile, might be updated with the design in the future.

1. Use a recent version of node (I use 16)
2. npm install
3. npm run start


Based on this [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/I60Tr7x2OyGh1dKqZc6E35/Exploration#182371135)
